  <h2>What is scope</h2>
  <p>

 It is an attribute added to the (th) element in tables to specify whether the header applies to a row or a column.
For example,scope="col" means it's a column header, and scope="row" means it's a row header.
</p>


<h2> how does it work to support accessibility:</h2>
  <p>

 
 When we define the scope,
  tools like screen readers can understand the relationship between headers and data in the table,
   making it easier for people who can't clearly see the table to understand the content.

  <table border="1" >
   
      <tr>
        <th scope="col">Name</th>
        <th scope="col">Age</th>
        <th scope="col">Grade</th>
   
    
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">Samar</th>
        <td>21</td>
        <td>Third</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">Layan</th>
        <td>22</td>
        <td>Second</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">Fahd</th>
        <td>20</td>
        <td>First</td>
      </tr>
  
  </table>
